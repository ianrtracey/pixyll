title: Ian Tracey - Hackathons
---
<p>I go to a lot of hackathons after starting <a href="http://hackarizona.org">Hack Arizona</a>, a 800+ student hackathon based at the <a href="#">University of Arizona</a>.</p>
<p> Hackathons are near and dear to my heart and over the years I have been humbled by the enthusiasm and inspiration that comes out of the hacker community. It has truly been a privledge to serve it.</p>
